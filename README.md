## 🧠 Goals

Cyberdoku aims to deliver a modern Sudoku experience with:

- Clean, touch-friendly SwiftUI interface
- Notes mode, mistake highlighting, and original cell tracking
- AI agents for suggestions, hints, and auto-solving
- Future support for Game Center and macOS

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning

Cyberdoku explores hybrid agents for intelligent move suggestions:

- **Rule-Based Agent**: Uses strategies like Naked Single and Hidden Single
- **ML Classifier**: A CoreML model trained on labeled move data to identify strategies
- **Training Data**: Automatically generated from puzzles and classified moves
- **Create ML**: Used to train a lightweight on-device model for fast inference

Planned: OpenAI agent for broader reasoning and advanced strategy synthesis.

## ✅ TODO

### 🔧 Core Features
- [x] Initialize Xcode SwiftUI project
- [x] Create `SudokuCell` model with notes and original flag
- [x] Set up GitHub repo and structure folders
- [x] Pick a name: **Cyberdoku**
- [x] Build `SudokuBoard` model with 9×9 access helpers
- [x] Create `SudokuBoardView` with SwiftUI grid
- [x] Implement serialization
- [x] Implement rule-based AI agent
- [x] Add CoreML agent interface
- [x] Add `TrainingDataGenerator` CLI to produce labeled data
- [x] Train and integrate CoreML model for move classification
- [x] Hook up hint button using rule-based and ML agents

### 🧪 Testing
- [ ] Add unit test for `MLMoveClassifier`
- [ ] Add test for `SudokuBoard+Classifier.swift` (`allUnits()`)

### 🧠 AI & Training
- [ ] Improve training dataset coverage with more "None" classifications
- [ ] Improve training dataset coverage with advanced strategies
- [ ] Add OpenAI agent interface (experimental)
- [ ] Build ML-based strategy recommender using classifier output
- [ ] Improve classifier evaluation (cross-validation, metrics)

### 🧬 UI and UX
- [x] Add main menu, about, settings
- [x] Add catalog of puzzles organized by difficulty
- [x] Make the board a little cleaner
- [ ] Clean up control interface
- [ ] Add UI feedback for AI vs human moves (e.g. highlighting)
- [ ] Add pencil note mode toggle and cell highlighting
- [x] Add multiline status/info box
- [ ] Style control buttons consistently and clearly
- [ ] Add a hint counter (smart, avoid double-counting)
- [ ] Polish UI with animations and dark mode
- [ ] Localize strings

### 💾 Persistence
- [ ] Save `SudokuViewModel` state to local storage
- [ ] Implement "resume game" functionality
- [ ] Clear game state from local storage when completed
- [ ] Add save/load logic to `Services/`

### 🎮 Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add Game Center integration (optional)
- [ ] Add puzzle generator?
- [ ] Add a training mode — capture a board and label the correct strategy
- [ ] Review CLI folder structure before adding more commands

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cyberdoku.git
open Cyberdoku/Cyberdoku.xcodeproj
```

Swift 5.9+ and Xcode 15+ recommended.

## 💡 Inspiration

This app is a blend of:
- The simplicity of classic Sudoku
- The declarative power of SwiftUI
- The creativity of AI-driven user assistance
